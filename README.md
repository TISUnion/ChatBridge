## Disclaimer

ChatBridge is mainly for custom use of TIS server, especially the bot/command components:

- CQHttp client
- Discord client
- Kaiheila client
- Online command client

Therefore for these bot and related clients:

- Expect hardcoded constants in codes and lack of document/usage/support
- PRs for features will not be accepted, related issues will probably be ignored
- If you want more features, fork this repository and implement them yourself

But the basic chatbridge components are within the support range, including:

- CLI client
- CLI server
- MCDR plugin 

## Usage

Enter `python ChatBridge.pyz` in command line to see possible helps

At launch, if the configure file is missing, chatbridge will automatically generate a default one and exit

## Requirement

Python 3.6+ required

Requirements stored in `requirements.txt`, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install

```
mcdreforged>=2.2.0
pycryptodome
colorlog
```
## Installer
Just execute `python ChatBridge.pyz installer` or `python3 ChatBridge.pyz installer` in the terminal
Follow the instruction [Video of installation](https://youtu.be/7Px4BQ36ZxE)
Is pretty easy using this, anyway you can ask me on discord: luisch444#3512

## CLI Server

```
python ChatBridge.pyz server
```

Configure:

```json5
{
    "aes_key": "ThisIstheSecret",  // the common encrypt key for all clients
    "hostname": "localhost",  // the hostname of the server. Set it to "0.0.0.0" for general binding
    "port": 30001,  // the port of the server
    "clients": [  // a list of client
        {
            "name": "MyClientName",  // client name
            "password": "MyClientPassword"  // client password
        }
    ]
}
```

## CLI Client

```
python ChatBridge.pyz client
```

## [MCDReforged](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged) plugin client

Required MCDR >=2.2

Just put the `.pyz` file into the plugin folder

Configure:

```json5
{
    "aes_key": "ThisIstheSecret",  // the common encrypt key
    "name": "MyClientName",  // the name of the client
    "password": "MyClientPassword",  // the password of the client
    "server_hostname": "127.0.0.1",  // the hostname of the server
    "server_port": 30001  // the port of the server
}
```

## Discord bot client

`python ChatBridge.pyz discord_bot`

Extra requirements (also listed in `/chatbridge/impl/discord/requirements.txt`):

```
discord.py
```

Extra configure fields (compared to CLI client)

```json5
    "bot_token": "your.bot.token.here",  // the token of your discord bot
    "channels_for_command": [  // a list of channels, public commands can be used here
        123400000000000000,
        123450000000000000
    ],
    "channel_for_chat": 123400000000000000,  // the channel for chatting and private commands
    "command_prefix": "!!",
    "client_to_query_stats": "MyClient1",  // it should be a client as an MCDR plugin, with stats_helper plugin installed in the MCDR
    "client_to_query_online": "MyClient2"  // a client described in the following section "Client to respond online command"
```

### Commands

`!!stats` will send command to `MyClient1` to query the StatsHelper plugin in the specific client for data

`!!online` will send command to `MyClient2` to use rcon to get `glist` command reply in bungeecord server

## Client as a CoolqHttp client

```
python ChatBridge.pyz cqhttp_bot
```

Extra requirements (also listed in `/chatbridge/impl/cqhttp/requirements.txt`):

```
websocket>=0.2.1
websocket-client>=1.2.1
```

Needs any CoolQ Http protocol provider to work. e.g. [go-cqhttp](https://github.com/Mrs4s/go-cqhttp)

Due to lack of channel division in QQ group (not like discord), to prevent message spam player needs to use special command to let the bot recognize the message:

- In MC (othe client) use `!!qq <message>` to send message to QQ
- In QQ use `!!mc <message>` to send message

Type `!!help` in QQ for more help

Extra configure fields (compared to CLI client)

`ws_address`, `ws_port` and `access_token` are the same as the value in the config file of coolq-http-api

```json5
    "ws_address": "127.0.0.1",
    "ws_port": 6700,
    "access_token": "access_token.here",
    "react_group_id": 12345,  // the target QQ group id
    "client_to_query_stats": "MyClient1",  // it should be a client as an MCDR plugin, with stats_helper plugin installed in the MCDR
    "client_to_query_online": "MyClient2",  // a client described in the following section "Client to respond online command"
    "server_display_name": "TIS"  // The name of the server, used for display in some places
```
